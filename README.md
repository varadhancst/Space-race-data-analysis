Analysis about Space race

I developed a data science project using Python and the Pandas and Plotly libraries to analyze and visualize the space race between different space agencies. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing data on space launches and missions, performing statistical analysis and generating insights, and creating interactive plots and visualizations using Plotly. The project demonstrated my ability to use Python and data science tools to explore and analyze complex datasets and to present the findings in a clear and engaging way.
